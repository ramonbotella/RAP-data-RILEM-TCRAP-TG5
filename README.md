# RAP-data-RILEM-TCRAP-TG5
This repository contains data obtained in the interlaboratory tests led by the Task Group 5 of the RILEM Techincal Committe on Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement.
17 labs tested more than 32 Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement samples, to produce this data.
The files rapdataTCRAPall.csv and rapdataMatlab.csv contain 4 elements in each row, namely compaction temperature in ºC, air voids in % of specimen's mass,  Indirect Tensile Strenght (ITS) at 25ºC in MPa and the Degree of Activity in % of the maximum ITS for that RAP sample.
Each folder contains the code to fit the Machine Learning model and the adapted data file.
