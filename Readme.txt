This repository contains the different codes that train validate and test supervised and unsupervised machine learning models related with the TG-5 of the RILEM TC-264
on Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement. Each folder contains all the files necessary to run each of the models.
/MPR: Multivariate Polynomial Regression that predicts DoA (% max. ITS) using compaction temperature (ºC), air voids (%) and ITS (MPa)
/ANN: Artificial Neural Network (2 hidden layer with 5 hidden units each) that predicts DoA (% max. ITS) using compaction temperature (ºC), air voids (%) and ITS (MPa)
/RFR: Random Forest Regression that predicts DoA (% max. ITS) using compaction temperature (ºC), air voids (%) and ITS (MPa)
